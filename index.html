            <p>Roy Hobbs or more commonly known as "The Natural" is a professional baseball player for the New York Knights. As a teenager, Hobbs was shot en route to a baseball tryout in Chicago and never made a major league team until he was 34 years old. After the death of the Knight's starting right fielder Bump Baily, Hobbs took over and led them on a playoff run for the century. As a rookie, Hobbs' stats were the best baseball had seen, hitting .350 with an OBP of .447 and an SLG of .750.</p>

            <p>On the way to a tryout with the Chicago Cubs, young baseball phenom Roy Hobbs is shot by the unstable Harriet Bird. After 16 years, Hobbs returns to pro baseball as a rookie for the last-place New York Knights. Despite early arguments with his manager, Pop Fisher, Hobbs becomes one of the best players in the league, and the Knights start winning. But this upsets the Judge, their owner, who wants Hobbs to lose games, not win.</p>
